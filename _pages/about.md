# About Me
Hi,there,

I am Peng You, a graduate student currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Management at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in data mining, database systems, and data structures. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, where I developed a strong foundation in machine learning, natural language processing, and object detection.

During my academic career, I’ve worked on notable projects, such as:

- **Thanking The World**: A research project analyzing the acknowledgment sections in academic theses using qualitative coding and NLP techniques to explore gender biases, language patterns, and academic success. I was responsible for data collection, processing, and application development using Python and the Streamlit framework.
  
- **Object Detection**: As part of my capstone project at Virginia Tech, I trained a YOLO V5 model to detect various components in ETDs (Electronic Theses and Dissertations), such as titles, author names, and page numbers. This project involved extensive data processing and labeling of over 10,000 pages.

In addition to my academic and research work, I gained practical experience during my internship as a Data Analyst at ByteStyle, where I learned data visualization techniques and gained expertise in tools like Excel, Power BI, and Python.

My skills include programming in Python, Java, SQL, C, and Ruby, as well as experience with technologies such as Linux, Firebase, Streamlit, and machine learning frameworks.

I’m passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and continuously expanding my knowledge in the fields of machine learning and data science.

Feel free to explore my [publications](#), [projects](#), and get in touch via [email](mailto:youpeng2@illinois.edu) for collaboration opportunities.
